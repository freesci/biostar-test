    <Text>Thanks, I think I'll try getting some help from the bioinformaticists here. In addition, I recently came across some other possibilities, have you or anyone here tried using CLC genomics workbench 3 (http://www.clcbio.com/index.php?id=1240) or SeqWeb GCG Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (http://www.hmc.psu.edu/core/computer/seqweb.htm)?  I know the SeqWeb is described in vague terms, but the CLC GW3 provides a means to do everything I need, in theory. </Text>

    <Text>yep but with cygwin you lose all the fun of using Linux or an Unix system. Moreover, it is very complicated to install new programs (I think you have to click on the installer again) or to compile new ones. As an an alternative, you can also install a virtual machine on Windows if you really need to do that.</Text>

I do think that there bioinformatics is particularly well suited for this question-answer type format. I am very pleased to see an influx of new users to the system.

    <Text>I have tried ruffus extensively, but in the end I decided I don't like its syntax. It complicates python's syntax and in the end, I recoded my pipeline as a simple python script, because I was getting errors that I couldn't understand well.

    <Text>I know it but since I have starting use make, I can't do anything without some certain features. For example, if you write a 'glue' script, you don't have conditional execution of tasks, so you will always have to run all the pipeline at once, without the possibility of pausing it. Or again, with makefiles, if you change only one of the input files, the program will only run the steps that are necessary to obtain the results, while a batch script will re-run everything. Moreover, a Makefile script has a standard syntax and it is easier to understand what is happening.</Text>

    <Text>no idea :-( Unfortunately I could never make it working. Anyway, since these are usually declarative-like syntax, you don't make loops, you just apply a function on an array of values (e.g. like in R with the apply function)</Text>

    <Text>well, a Makefile with phony rules is not much difficult to write. Even if you use a script only once, it is useful to write down the options and the files on which you have launched it. Moreover, sometimes you use binary files like the ones from emboss or blast, which have lot of options, and you need to annotate the options you have used to make your results reproducible.</Text>

    <Text>Thanks. I think waf is too much oriented towards compiling programs, I have tried to use it but I don't think it is very useful for what we need to do. As for your third point, I use a lot of .Phony targets, which means that I just use a generic name (e.g. align_sequences, get_data, calculate_x) and the list of commands, with few dependencies. A bit like how I have shown in these slides: http://bioinfoblog.it/?p=29</Text>

    <Text>Thank you. These are genomic contigs. "Metagenomics" is accidental. Input DNA was from two sources, one of which contained bacterias. 
No idea if these come from dirty root, lived between plant cells, within them(?) but it does not look like bacterial lab strain jumping to a new bottle.  
 Sequence produced by 454s, assembled by Newbler. My contigs are anywhere from 100bp to 1Mbp. So I am expecting one plant genome and at least one, possibly many bacterial species. Single, 1Mb  large bacterial contig can hit multiple species of bacteria (blastp using predicted genes, 40-70% similarity hits).</Text>

    <Text>Many plants undergo symbiotic interactions with soil-bacteria, e.g. legume palnts and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, these form root nodules. If you sample from the wild, you have possibly discovered the plant and its symbiont(s) in between root cells, otherwise just dirt. Just speculation, depends on how you got the sample.

Anyway, maybe then it's maybe best to sort out the individual reads on the domain level (bacteria vs. eukaryota) and assemble afterwards. At least if mainly interested in a pure assembly.

    <Text>re reassembly: indeed this is what we will do in the end. But since we already have draft assembly reducing the total sequence length I went for contig screen first. As a bonus one can confirm that 454 contigs contain our plant DNA by mapping (blast pre-screened) ESTs, GSS sequences and Illumina short reads from bacteria-free (so far...) leaves / mRNAs.    </Text>

Surely it may be interesting in the longer run how do we return the favors (authorship? $$$, invitation to give a talk?) but often person asking the question is not at the helm (can not promise much).

Thanks for your reply. I am trying to find out what percentage of peptides in my library share a same biological process or have same molecular function .These peptides have length between 17-22 residues and Pfam was giving the annotation for a test run which I carried out a few weeks before.

    <Text>I'm still a bit confused: are these peptides experimentally shown to be present in the sample as such short peptides? Or are they fragments of large proteins that have been digested and sequenced?
In any case, you cannot predict the function of peptides just because that sequence is present in a full blown protein that has a function... I'd even say that it is not biologically relevant :(

But, if you have a bunch of peptides that are sequenced from a sample and you manage to map them back to a protein, then you can find out what Pfam domains that protein has and get an idea of its function.</Text>

    <Text>Have you looked at their web site or downloadable files ? AFAIK, STRING basically use Ensembl IDs in their PPI files but provide another mapping file to map from other identitfiers. The problem of mapping a gene to a pathway is always not a direct approach, think of this scenario : 1 gene, n transcript and one of them could go in to pathway. 'n' transcripts code for n splice variants of same protein, so it is not wrong in merging the IDs of transcripts to one gene ID.</Text>

    <Text>Daniel, True. Back in India, in my lab we used to get Systems engineers to help us with O/S or any critical systems issues. I can install and CentOS and get it up and running, but it need considerable amount to tweak things. I am looking for something like a pre-installed OS with a service contract. I already got some quotes. But, don't have any experience with the vendors in US. </Text>

It is quite fast to count all 4-mers in my draft sequence. I think I have to count them on a reverse strand and add it to forward counts (done). For implementing TETRA-measure I will start with RPy.

    <Text>Sorry, I was to vague here. I am looking at the effects of a certain set of transcription factors in a certain tissue. There seem to be some interesting patterns of co-operation between them. Whether these TFs are able to interact in the first place depends on whether all of them are actually expressed in this tissue. That's what I want to find out with this exercise. -- Thanks for your help !</Text>

    <Text>Thanks all, yes I had two good reads on each strand and the single bp on one of the colonies was different from that of the other colony (I'd picked 3 originally, but one was just an insert).  I went with picking another 2 colonies to be sure.  I'm sequencing ~100 markers though, so I was trying to weigh up the extra $$ / time in sequencing another colony with the extra information a C or T gives me over a Y.  This is only the 15th sequence or so and the first time this has happened, so I'll see how the others turn out before deciding on a general policy.</Text>

    <Text>Actually, what I'd really like to know is when you go to publish a sequence like this, how much coverage should you have?  Is it acceptable to put a sequence with a Y into genbank, because you didn't go to the effort / cost of re-sequencing to resolve it?

    <Text>I can't agree with you when you say that building and interpreting a phylogenetic tree should be trivial to any person with a background in biology.

    <Text>I say that because I firmly believe that this should be a skill that any biologist can have. Tools like www.Phylogeny.fr and Mega (megasoftware.net) greatly reduce the time and work need to build a phylogenetic tree. Since evolution is a core concept in biology, the foundation to  interpret a tree is already explored in most undergraduate courses I know.</Text>

    <Text> In true, for quickly build a tree, it is only a matter to run a BLAST search and from the results page click in the "Distance tree of results" link. Sure, this may not be a good tree built with the most sofisticated methods, but is a good start to a more complete analysis. I am not saying that philogenetics as a whole is trivial, just the specific task to build a simple tree and interpreting the branching pattern resulting from it. </Text>

    <Text>I play around with phylogenetics. It's not simple. And yes, I understand the importance it has in biology. But, sorry, I still can't agree with you. You're view and experience seem limited if you think that every University teaching biology goes into the concept of phylogenetics. In particular there are a lot that focus on medical issues and they really don't care about it.

    <Text>I think we are arguing about a different point of view. Maybe due to a particular bias. I am in Brasil and here all biology courses consider phylogenetics pretty seriously, undergraduates seeking to work in medical issues generally goes to medical school. Anyway, I think that even biomedical students can greatly benefit if they start to think about medical problems from an evolutionary perspective. This will be particularly important with the coming availability of a vast number of sequenced human genomes.</Text>

    <Text>Michael - what I really want is to compare (some areas of, for example, the D loop in) tRNA's from different species.
In order to do so, I need to know that I am looking at the D loop in all of them, but it is located in different numbering in different tRNA's from different species.  I could just copy paste the websites result (for an aligned sequence, based on the COVE model and the secondary folding of the tRNA) - but I had hoped for a more generic (and thus, scalable) solution for getting these aligned sequences (then using copy paste).</Text>

    <Text>Thanks Chris. I think what I was thinking of was more on the lines of functional redundancy arising from evolutionary convergence (rather than say gene duplication). As to what exactly is meant by "redundant", you point out interesting variations.

My question originates from RNAi screens. If knockdown of gene X does not result in a loss-of-function phenotype is it because X is not involved in that phenotype? Or is it because X is knocked down, but a functionally equivalent gene (or pathway) can take over the function?</Text>

    <Text>Sorry to interrupt this "discussion", but the statement that phylogenetics is easy is unjustified. But because it might be me who just cannot grasp the "trivial trees" could you Marcos explain me how I can relate/interpret posterior branch probabilities with bootstrapping values and what to do if they differ significantly? And which of the two approaches for consensus/super-tree reconstruction using majority-rule voting is more relevant evolutionarily i.e. closer to the real evolution.  </Text>

    <Text>Marcin, please consider my other comments. I didn't want to say that phylogenetics is easy. But, build a simple phylogenetic tree and interpret it can be. Please, point me where I told that phylogenetics is easy. Remember that not all problems are ultra-hard and need the most sophisticated inference methods or supertrees to be solved. I definitely wasn't trying to be pedant, pretty much the inverse. See my example about buiding a tree from BLAST results, what can be more simple? Yes, it may not be the most accurate, etc, but sometimes you only need that. That is what I am talking about.</Text>

    <Text>Pierre and Marcos, I'll just emphasize the key word in your statement: SHOULD. And that is my point... You all seem to evolve in the world of bioinformatics and you understand phylogenetics. But, when it comes to their own work, many biologists (yes, I insist, they are biologists, even if they don't understand phylogenetics) in wet labs do not understand the meaning of phylogenetic relationships. Yes they understand that you can make a "species tree", but no, they don't relate it to what they do, i.e. they don't understand it and they do not value it.</Text>

    <Text>I am sorry Nicojo, but what you are asking me for is that I admit that is ok for a biologist not understand a phylogenetic tree. This is like saying it is ok for a chemist not understand the acid/base concepts, as long as he works with nuclear chemistry. I can't agree. </Text>

    <Text>Marcos, would we have Rock music if all musicians had to go to the conservatory and learn Brahms first? I don't think so, but I'm probably wrong... I do agree that this is a very important and fundamental aspect of biology. I'm sorry I made all this fuss over this topic. I'm usually fighting with wet lab biologists to try and make them understand that bioinformaticians are also biologists! In any case, even if I disagree, still I respect your take on the matter, and I'll even use it next time I argue with the others ;). Thanks for your patience with my arguments!</Text>

If your statement is true and indeed building a tree from a family of genes is a trivial task to anyone, then my PhD is a terrible mistake is a terrible mistake because I try to give answers to trivial questions like "what is a family of genes" or "how to interpret a phylogenetic tree". </Text>

    <Text>I agree, this seems like the best way to accomplish your goal - don't overcomplicate with BioPython where it simply isn't necessary. By the way, you can grab the sequences you need from UniProt: search for "organism:$tax_id AND keyword:"Complete proteome"" where $tax_id is the taxonomy identifier of the strain you're interested in (so E. coli K12 is 83333 and C jejuni is 197). Though this method does rely on the curation levels of UniProt, which may not be so good for organisms a little off the beaten track.</Text>

    <Text>a) The TCGA (GBM) is up to something like 150 samples now, but they aren't doing whole genome resequencing at this point. The first draft resequenced 600 selected genes, and they're bumping that number up, but still using targeted capture.</Text>

    <Text>Well, Wave works well for us... most of the time. One of my collaborators had a problem recently where he couldn't update anything (unsynced). A change of browser fixed it though. The "extentions" list is growing, which is good too. Maybe you should give it another try!</Text>

    <Text>Hi Jarretinha... It would be good if you could add links. For instance I assume HCFMUSP is in Brazil, but honestly, the abreviation doesn't mean anything to me. Also, lots of people won't know what an FPGA is: you could make that a link to Wikipedia. Same with the different commercial solutions you're suggesting etc.</Text>

    <Text>In this particular case, you can not talk about natural variation: you are sequencing fragments you've cloned into a plasmid! Unless you've contaminated your prep with two colonies from the plate, all the plasmids in one prep should be identical. If you have ambivalent bases, then it's because your sequencing is of bad quality. You should never submit bad quality data to Genbank.</Text>

    <Text>CUDA are on my whishlist. I've just acquired a SuperServer 6016GT-TF and totally intend to fill it up with NVIDIA Tesla/Fermi . CUDA for Bioinformatics really works. And it is quite affordable.

Cell are nice but hard to program/port. Compilers/libs for this type of architecture aren't in good shape right now. Anyway, the speedup is comparable to that in CUDA. OpenCL too isn't mature enough. 

By the way, Xlinx FPGAs possess PowerPC cores which makes them some sort of Cell when properly assembled.

    <Text>Most people here deal with sequence data and microarrays. So, the basic idea is to use FPGAs to sequence data (higher demand) and CUDAs to microarrays and related. Molecular dynamics and related stuff rely on another cluster. 
&lt;p&gt;
Here, we will develop solutions on FPGAs (the utmost dream is a FPGA card able to perform Burrows-Wheeler transform based alignments). WE are the tinkerers . . .
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, some people might want a proprietary solution. It's good to know they are worth the trouble, though.</Text>

    <Text>In this case I sequenced more colonies and found a consensus sequence, however, I'm cloning PCR products, so I don't think it is possible to say that there could not be natural variation in the PCR amplicon pool.  One good example would be a bacterium with 2 different 16s inside a single cell, this could produce 2 populations  of PCR products.  If the ratio were 1:3, how often would you have to sample cloned colonies in order to observe this natural variation?</Text>

    <Text>1) It's pretty easy to slurp down all 18k gene names and locations from someplace like Santa Cruz, and store it in a file locally.  This gets trickier if you're worried about aliases and such, in which case you'll want to do something like Neil or Pierre suggest and query a web service.

2) Credit where credit is due - Neil pointed me to the seqinr package the other day

while /martwsdl is the wsdl location. Whith soapui, you just put in the wsdl and the rest is automatic. Good luck! </Text>

    <Text>Jeremy - are you talking about the gene lengths? It's pretty easy to parse through the gene list from UCSC line by line and find just the length between first and last exon.  I'd probably parse it with Ruby or Perl first, then read the results into R.

If you actually need the sequence, I'd probably change my recommendation to the BSGenome package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.3/bioc/html/BSgenome.html) in combination with the BioStrings package.  It'll hold the whole genome in about 500mb which makes it easier to handle.</Text>

    <Text>Let me say that I do understand the tests. I'm one of the guys who develops statistical tests for such an end. My questions is about reliability, not power or accuracy. I found out that my notion of reliability (which is based on statistical mechanics ideas)  is too much different from that of peple on the wet bench. IMHO microarrays are not suitable for differential gene expression &amp; similar experiments (way too high type-II error rate). But, as experimentalists keep using it, reliability still is a important matter.</Text>

    <Text>The data underlying the torrents cannot be modified because unlike files that are downloaded by name it has check-sums that must match. You would need to publish a new torrent for modified data. So torrents are actually more reliable than a download. The second issue of disappearing data is also a vote for torrents. Unlike a download that can disappear unless someone republishes it on an FTP site a torrent is automatically distributed and shared thus it will live on even if the original source is gone.</Text>

    <Text>Can you give a short definition of what you mean by reliability in the statistical sense? I confess I had to look up the definition myself, but if it is as is wikipedia "In statistics, reliability is the consistency of a set of measurements or measuring instrument, often used to describe a test. Reliability is inversely related to random error." then the question makes no sense, because most or all normalization methods are deterministic.</Text>

    <Text>If you develop the tests, you should be telling us which are the most reliable :-)

I tend to agree with Michael's comment at the top. Normalization is not a measurement. If anything, the raw intensity is the measurement. But it is not a measurement in the same way that, say, putting a thermometer in water is a measurement. You might have a hypothesis about what observed intensities should be, but variation will ensure that this will never be consistent.

I also agree with you that many microarray experiments are poor measures of gene expression - but that's the way the science chose to go.</Text>

    <Text>I am afraid this is not exactly I am looking for. I wanted to check if a particular SNP is not mapped to a gene, whether there will be any known genes in +/- 60KB of that SNP. This particular BioMart query is fetching the sequence not annotation. I have tried one with annotation and it works. : http://www.biomart.org/biomart/martview/c26efcafd362abccc4af83039c441762.  But sometimes BioMart out put requires lot of post-processing. Also it will be nice if BioMart can have options to select fields multiple attributes. </Text>

    <Text>It's true that many models are deterministic. But, the most used are model-based. Hence, stochastic/statistical in its nature (e. g. RMA). If one treats normalization as an experiment (which indeed it is), this question makes a lot of sense, though.</Text>

    <Text>Is I said in other comments, one can treat the normalization procedure as an experiment over the raw intensities. There is no legal impediment to do that. The normalization procedure will be you thermometer. And, just to remember, RMA do have hypothesis about intensities.</Text>

    <Text>Normalization is the main source of variability (or lack of it) in microarray data. As the intensity level is non-linear and most normalization procedures do use a linear model, the choice of the model do alter the final result. </Text>

    <Text>RMA depends on a linear statistical model. You can check it on the paper if you want. I agree with you if you use a given linear model and OLS  it will give the same results. Still, it is a statistical model. But, normalization is not so simple !!! People use a wealth of techniques. If it was just linear regression, this question would be trivial. But, as it depends on many instances on M-estimators, specific training sets, etc., I still think that its not solved. Otherwise, people wouldn't gather on a room for two days to discuss which one is the most reliable. </Text>

    <Text>I've checked. Most methods are statistical and rely on parameter estimation for normalization. Looking to 1000 samples is almost the as Monte Carlo estimation. Of course it will produce the same result, at least on average. It's not a complicated question. I asked for the realiability of the method !!! Even quantile normalization relies on parameter estimation. My question is totally unrelated to the precision of one's computer . . . </Text>

    <Text>No, not on average, exactly.  I recommend you really try this out before you claim something. But use one and the same dataset and run the same method, say RMA 1000 times, then publish the result here. Also, you are mistakenly interchanging parameter estimation for non-deterministic outcome. So please, try it out with  one technique first.

    <Text>I have nothing personally against SOAP but I found it was a watershed moment when Google dropped support for its SOAP Search API. As I understand it there will always been a need for SOAP for really complex queries but any time you need a special library just to interact with a data source you are introducing another ingredient into the mix that can confuse people. So it is kind of a lowest common denominator thing.</Text>

    <Text>This is interesting, I don't (or rather haven't yet) submitted sequence data to NCBI or EBI, but I have submitted to ArrayExpress and GEO.  When I do this we just put a release date on the data in the future, generate a private reviewer URL or access for the reviewers and submit the paper.  The reviewers can see the data is annotated and deposited, and it's released on publication.  

So why isn't this the same for sequence data?</Text>

    <Text>Clarifying the meaning: the intensity level scale is non-linear. Just to mention: RMA, GC-RMA, fRMA, quantile use a linear model. I'm sure I can find more examples. And a random reference about methods says: "Consistent with previous results we observed a large effect of the normalization method on the outcome of the expression analyses.". This observation is quite reasonable as the intensity scale (which defines the experiment) will be normalized. </Text>

    <Text>Thanks for your note Ian. I have noticed that differential expression levels in these probe sets mapped to same gene. For example, I noticed a particular probe set ID 'x' is up regulated in 'cases'. But in 'controls', instead of this probe set ID 'x' another probe set ID 'y' which mapped to same gene is upregulated. I am a bit confused If I can consider them as a differentially expressing hit. Or results should be reported only based on the consistent regulation of probe IDs. Please let me know your thoughts. </Text>

    <Text>Hi Khader.

You have hit on something really pretty important. There are times as you have illustrated where two different probe-sets behave differently  even when they map to the same gene. This is obviously a bit of a worry so when this happens I like to try to work out if there is a sensible explanation, if I cannot find one the best you can do is either flag them with a warning or exclude them. As a simple rule of thumb I would check that neither (or both) of them aren't promiscuous, secondly check whether one or both falls across a splice junction..(continued, below...)</Text>

    <Text>....if they do you may be getting a different (or weighted) change in expression between the probe-sets based on the differential expression (or stability) of the splice variants. This is where you need to apply a bit of biology 'nous' to understand something about the mapped genes themselves. One other possibility is that for example if it was profile data the probe-sets may have the same expression shape, but just a different magnitude. If you think this is possible you could try unitising all of your expression vectors (i.e. giving each a length of one) and then seeing if they converge.</Text>

Ruffus has undergone substantial development lately, especially to simplify the syntax and improve the error messages. If your experience was with the ruffus of a few months ago, it might be worth having a quick look again and seeing if it has improved enough to change your mind.

    <Text>I am the developer of Ruffus (and just posted a reply to Istvan above). 

Ruffus has recently acquired much more tracing (like make -n but understandable), and a "touch" mode (like make -t you can update selected parts of the pipeline). 

I am always interested from people still using make as it was the frustrations of unmaintainable makefiles which drove us to develop Ruffus in the first place. I would be very grateful if you could email me more comments / feedback if you don't mind.
Thanks</Text>

    <Text>I'm aware of the nontriviality of such an endeavour. But, as we have legal difficulties to hire qualified people, this is our best bet. Hard time fo find some examples of the architecture of such a service. Right now I just need to provide a prototype of the workbench. Thinking about Zope/Plone or Django/Plone to produce the interface/front end. </Text>

    <Text>I should confess I am a member of the CARMEN project and that we ended up building a system from scratch for this without managing to deploy a single reused component people might recognise from Pierre's list..  I was not in charge of the architecture details.  We do use Plone as the CMS associated with the project, but not as a front end to the workflow/data/services portal.</Text>

    <Text>This could be a limitation on the API as the web interface allows a reasonable proxy to a pubmed search although at present it doesn't support the [tags] search that I really like using for Pubmed searches (i.e. bloggs_j[1AU]). Still it looks pretty useful.</Text>

    <Text>As R is an interpreted language it basically will not beat an implementation in something like C or C++.

It also has memory issues (it loads a lot into memory). None of these are insurmountable and the availability of lots of powerful stats functionality in R makes it attractive.

If a piece of the code I'm working with is problematic I implement it in C and then access it from R. If memory is an issue I use something like 'ff' or read data in from a database as I need it. The alternative I guess is to use proprietary software like SAS or Matlab.</Text>

    <Text>Thanks Daniel, we don't have this on our HPC nodes just the canonical R release, that could be a cost thing. Not sure if it would be free if the University put it on a service, but that's something they could find out. I will definitely ask them about it and try it out on my local cluster in the meantime.</Text>

    <Text>Thanks for that. I am currently solving the problem by the former i.e. splitting, batching then collating and performing summary analyses. In the mid-&gt;long term however I need the latter. There are already some emerging, truly parallelized, functions that I can take advantage of that will deliver significant speed up. My question specifically is trying to ascertain what if anything people are using in terms of packages and R with HPC resources. There are a few suggestions here that I am following up. Even simple functions in parallel form such as 'sort' can be extremely useful.</Text>

    <Text>I admit that this is premature and I have not done my due diligence.  All I have done so far (I thought of this last night watching a show where cicada were all over the place) is went to Entrez and only found one article relating to the periodical cicada.  I am getting the article through our college library.  
My initial thought was dealing with evolution and if we could see any divergence between the populations since they are gentically isolated.  How do I know that I have searched enough to comfortably say that these populations have not been sequenced?  </Text>

    <Text>Thanks for the input.  As a community college instructor, it is frustrating to just go over a technique with very little revelevance.  Adding something, anything, where they are contributing something, even if it just sequences to various databases is better than nothing!
I just want to give my students any type of experience that will make them better prepared for transferring to a university, so even if it is not publishable, but maybe could do a poster presentation would be great.</Text>

    <Text>To be clear, I don't mean to dig on your idea at all. I think it's fantastic that you want to involve students in some real research. It just seems like you're not even to the point where you know what questions to ask. With any new project, there's a ramp up phase, where you spend some time digging around in the literature to see what's been done and what needs to be done. That should be your first step.</Text>

    <Text>One good thing about cicadas is that people can relate to them ... Thus anything you may find has a better chance to be talked about in the news and other circles. As Pierre said those are prime numbers, and prime numbers are quite uncommon in nature. Finding out how that time is kept has many implications. Definitely team up with someone who has access to sequencing facility. </Text>

    <Text>I also think that any new data submitable to GenBank is better than sequencing the same plasmid over and over again :-).

What I was trying to say is that sometimes not very sophisticated methods (Feulgen staining is ancient) can produce very useful results. Good if you go for name recognition on a tight budget.

DNA cloning and sequencing is way more widely used in labs so it makes sense to go for it with students.</Text>

    <Text>That's a fair critique, PhiS. Still, you should have some idea of what you're getting after. My point was that sequencing an organism without a reason or plan is a bad idea, as the methods you use will depend on what answers you're looking for.</Text>

    <Text>That's a fair critique, PhiS. Still, you should have some idea of what you're getting after. I guess my point was that sequencing an organism without a reason or plan is a bad idea, as the methods you use will depend on what answers you're looking for</Text>

    <Text>Thanks everyone for the answers. In the end I'm going for Revolution-R as the best answer mainly because it is a big step forward for learning and programming in parallel with R. It includes at install the domC and multicore packages that Chris mentioned and achieves some pretty impressive speed ups on processes like matrix multiplication. Watch out for it hammering the CPUs though.</Text>

    <Text>This is a great and nice answer! Thanks Michael! But, top brands are underrepresented in Brazil. Most solution specialists are friends of mine from grad/undergrad times. For instance, IBM regularly hires people like myself for solution deployment, validation and maintenance. There are very few HPC (official) vendors, too. Our connection is already fibre (nice!!!). It's good to hear that in the end bioinformatics data are not so different. I'll talk with other sysadmins right now. The system accepts hotswap already. Using ext4. I'm not very comfortable with cryptography. Any recomendation?</Text>

    <Text>Patenting is a different issue really.  I think that a small proportion of sequences are withheld for patenting purposes although there is no way to know what is being stored being the wall of private biotechs. I am interested in knowing what most people do with their sequences: release them a soon as they have been quality checked; wait until they are submitting a manuscript; wait until the manuscript is accepted.</Text>

    <Text>If you're looking at providing R services you might want to look at http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/ "Rserve is a TCP/IP server which allows other programs to use facilities of R (see www.r-project.org) from various languages without the need to initialize R or link against R library. Every connection has a separate workspace and working directory. Client-side implementations are available for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java. Typical use is to integrate R backend for computation of statstical models, plots etc. in other applications."</Text>

    <Text>Hmm, maybe not the worst idea to buy a ready-made rack from e.g. HAL, Sun/Oracle, but of course, it's maybe hard to find the retailer of your trust. Reg. bioinformatics data, maybe the main difference in the future (high-th. seq, -omics) is that one has to make the decision, which data you can afford to store and which you can afford to throw away. That's the bioinformatics decision.
 Also transfer of a TB data from sequencer to storage is a problem. Some sequencers (eg 454 titanium) have compute clusters attached that due the processing and (temp.) storage. </Text>

    <Text>I agree, SOAP is *not* difficult, especially if you use a SOAP implementation like Axis2 or JavaWS. Moast depends on the WSDL being made correctly. soapenc:array is a big lagacy problem. That comes when people don't know how to do their XML schema of complex types right. It's a shame that very large institutions are unable ore unwilling to test their services properly. </Text>

I think the most crucial part of the storage is not the vendor or technology but the *competence* represented by the people planning and running it, with full-time sys-admins.

Disaster is guaranteed if only one poor bioinformatician is hired to do the research and to build up the infrastructure.</Text>

    <Text>Wow !!! This Bioteam is very nice. Thank ya, mndoci! I really appreciate case studies. BTW, I'm the poor bioinformatician. Not alone as we have good IT infra/people. But, NGS/arrays/related will hit hard the diagnostic barrier this year. You can imagine what a very large/rich reference hospital will do. Anyway, storage solutions are complex in our scale and needs. None of us have the required experience. Our cardio division uses a complete proprietary solution with a proprietary database and still suffer from problems regularly. They didn't get the specific needs. So, any tip is handy!</Text>

    <Text>I really prefer the cluster way to solve the question, i.e., to build the solution around the data. As I said, HPC vendors in Brazil are lame. It's much easier to deploy your own solution, even with abundant funding. Data triage and other biocuration tasks will be addressed soon. I think that transfer will not be much of a problem. But, long term storage for legal reasons will be a pain in the ass, certainly.</Text>

    <Text>To answer what assembler you should use, we really need more information.

What kind of data do you have ?

How many organisms/species are in the sample you want to sequence ?

What do you want to do with the resulting assemblies ?

    <Text>To begin with, I haven't worked with genome assembly before and I'm just trying to understand how the various tools in a metagenomics workflow work...

At present, I don't have the actual data and I'm still 'playing' with simulated datasets generated by MetaSim that contain only bacterial sequences (both Sanger and 454). In the next stage I'll add some fungi, too. Regarding the number of species I've started with only 2 bacterial genomes! Last, the end target is to perform gene calling, taxonomic profiling etc</Text>

    <Text>A friend of mine (who deploys clusters) said the same thing. But I saw CLCbio cube in action in a large dataset and got very impressed. And we have some issues about energy consumption (watt per flop). That's why I'm looking for people with some experience with these things. By the way, the cloud isn't mature enough to deliver the same performance as in-house cluster. Check out this example - http://www.genomeweb.com/sites/default/files/walker.pdf</Text>

    <Text>Michael, storage solutions are extremely complex and very finicky.  There is a reason some of the big storage vendors can charge as much as they can, cause they are essentially selling performance and reliability as a brand.  At scale though that starts breaking down and you are better served by commodity hardware with the software layer handling failure.  And yes, you can't live in a world with a non-expert handling your infrastructure needs.</Text>

    <Text>The example you pointed too is about a type of HPC computing that is largely irrelevant to bioinformatics, sharing a lot of data between processes.
What we usually see in sequence analysis is another way of parallelisation, do the same type of analysis on a lot of data.
A good example of cloud based computing is Cloudburst ; http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cloudburst-bio/index.php?title=CloudBurst</Text>

    <Text>You can get a similar results with UCSC exchanging class="single" by class="in-del". Of course you could use class="single" OR class="in-del". But, indels aren't treat like SNPs despite some being SNPs in a HapMap sense. You could have for instance a A/T/G/AT. An -/A/T make sense but I haven't found any.</Text>

    <Text>Bioinformatics don't stop at genome assembly or microarray analysis. Most of what I do depends on sharing a lot of data. Certain types of aligment, too. I know that CFD is way too different, but many phylogenetics tasks lie in EP category. Most population genetics tasks lie in the EP/FT category. And many systems biology lie in CG. Your example is just the entry point of the bioinformatics pipeline. Just try to compute the unrooted phylogeny of all Archaea using complete genomes and you'll see the problem.</Text>

    <Text>Hi, if you want answers to this question you should provide more instant information on the topic. This will also make this question useful to others, which it now definitely is not. What is abyss/  abyss-explorer? (It's a rather novel transcriptome assembler) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19834150

Did you ask the authors: ibirol@bcgsc.ca, abyss-users@bcgsc.ca , ask them first, what did they answer?

I looked at the pages, seems like both programs are very poorly documented at first glance. Ask the authors for additional documentation, maybe.

    <Text>Actually, GBrowse can use either flat, GFF-format files or a database backend.  Use of in-memory GFF files is not recommended for anything other than very small datasets.  GBrowse can use MySQL or BerkeleyDB and you can also employ the Chado and BioSQL schemas.  GBrowse can also act as a DAS client.

    <Text>I know that MAQ can call a given SNP over a reference. But, to detect a poly-allelic site is way more complicated. Consider the HIV case. Now you have a collection of reads from different subjects (i.e. a population sample) and needs to decide if the variation in a given locus is poly-allelic. How does MAQ do that?</Text>

    <Text>From the population genetics point of view SNP detection is quite complicated. It depends on sample size, effective population size and other hard-to-measure parameters. Using very conservative parameters to estimate the expected number of SNPs in humans give us around 182000. So, there is a lot of space in this direction. And no software in hand. This will be FUN!!!</Text>

    <Text>That depend on your ploidy level. Cancer cell lines can be highly polyploid for certain regions/chromosomes. So, it's possible that a given locus carry 3 or more SNPs. That's common in cultivated plants, too. Wheat cultivars are typically dodecaploid. So, you question is relevant, but not easy.</Text>

I'd prefer to see integration of these libraries with Biopython instead of reimplementing. We have PyCogent Ensembl targeted as part of our Google Summer of Code ideas:

http://biopython.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code#Biopython_and_PyCogent_interoperability

I'd be interested in hearing how they work out for you since I haven't had a need to use them in my work yet.</Text>

    <Text>Thanks, I added the cyanobase line so it can be run.  Actually, the problem was simpler than the vector answer you gave below.  the description was "CDS" but the name was "coding".

    <Text>For your results to qualify as a scientific study you must follow your institution' survey policies, disclose your data usage and retention practices etc. there are many rules you will need to follow. I would also agree that these question would be better formulated as a standalone survey rather than a public question/answer. Finally questions 2 and 3 seem ill defined. For 2 the definitions are missing: "visual science" may mean different things to various individuals. No 3 forces people to use a very broad brush to characterize others - nothing good can come of that.</Text>

    <Text>You're welcome. As you probably noticed there are a very large number of filtering options available with BioMart which you could certainly formulate into detailed analyses. The benefit of using Ensembl is that it essentially syndicates a lot of the data that you might otherwise have to trawl multiple databases (and with different access methods) to find. The pipelines also include many predictive tool outputs that you might not have realised were hidden in there !</Text>

    <Text>Can you provide some more information? I think this is a very interesting toppic, but also a very complex one. I would like to know about the input data for the software. I assume it takes the genotypes of each person as a vector like f.e. (C,C/A,T,T/A), is that correct?
Does the software recognize the sub-groups at all if you give the whole population data?  I mean, can you specify sub-groups at all?

Did you contact the author already?

    <Text>I don't know anyone who lets a PCI-e 16x empty. Most mobos don't have two slots of this type with enough space for even two Tesla. A GPU is an quite obvious choice. But, what if your mobo has 3 PCI 33Mhz? Or 4 PCI 4x in a 8x slot? You can check Tyan, Supermicro and other brands and see these strange configurations for yourself. </Text>

    <Text>No worries... :) What about the second question... let's assume a 'dimensionality space' is identical to a 'n-dimensional space' (I think it is, and I asked for a formal definition to confirm this use in literature), what would you call the space that spans these n-dimensional spaces? There is the Hilbert space for functions with certain properties... what would a space be called containing 0-dimensional space, 1-dimensional space, 2-dimensional space, ... , n-dimensional space?</Text>

    <Text>I think it not. Now, in your example one has to deal with strings of size 3-7. So, there is something missing in your formula. And, for implementation purposes, this problem has a lot of symmetries (reversals, palindromes, etc.) that you can use.</Text>

    <Text>I think I got it !
Consider a modification at a given position as :
 - a substitution with a letter of the alphabet
 - or a substitution with an indel
 - or the insertion of an indel

You have all possible modifications at a given position. Instead of counting letters, let (a) be the number of possible modifications, then the equation holds. </Text>

    <Text>Yeah. Now you really got the point. But the stackoverflow post gives a good hint on how to generate possible paths. I know that's a huge number of sequences. That's why I'm asking for tips on how to implement it. But, as you precisely noted, the combinatorics of the problem is interesting too. Now, imagine that after this part I will add some physical calculations on each sequence. Got the gist?</Text>

At first it sounds superfluous but then since so much of the discussion happens via email, it would actually be very neat way to be able to easily associate and store that discussion with the project. The way to do it would be to either create a sendmail configuration that reads the incoming mail and uploads it to a URL or regularly parse the inbox from the LIMS.</Text>

IMHO it is still great to do some DNA quality checking using SS before loading your DNA in Illumina/454 or for assembly finishing/improvement. The 454s or Illumina's paired reads will give you way more data.

    <Text>I think what is changing the way we think is more in  novel applications of fast sequencing methods: RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, methylation profiling or conformation detection (C3 seq). Found this for example: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703132.

New applications are made possible by increasing speed, while they increase the demands to speed, which allows for more novel apps and so on (very much alike CPU power).</Text>

    <Text>Oooops sorry I haven't been alerted that there was a comment to answer.
The inpout data is as following:
a genotypefile: for each individual 2 vector of A/T/G/C, one per chromosome
a (facultative) population file: where you precise the population code for each individual.
And that's it!
So I do not know if you know the HGDP panel: I have 39 populations in 7 regions.
I did precise the appartenance to one of 39 populations for each individual.
Do you need more precision?

    <Text>No. What you would get then is a regression table containing the different p-values for your X1 to X3 factors. A standard approach is to construct a big model, containing all the factors of interest and their interactions. Then, from the table, you spot the biggest p-value. If it is above your criterion (eg: 0.05), you remove that factor or interaction. You repeat the process until all factors are significant. What you have then is the minimal model that explains the variation found in your data. Cheers!</Text>

    <Text>We can be fairly sure the code is tested - only that this is not the right place to show/distribute them. As for FASTA parsing, indeed there are many choices, though the vast majority of them have substantial limitations. Although a seemingly simple task, the problem of parsing a FASTA file not nearly as easy to solve as most people assume. Take your FASTA reader; use it to extract the last 100 bases of chrom1 of the human genome. Now use the same FASTA reader to count 50 million short reads with it. You will soon see that most implementation fail spectacularly at one or both of these tasks.</Text>

    <Text>Yeah, when I say raw it's as raw as you can. Raw as in fresh meat. I do know that a whole run on any NGS machine is too much data for any connection. But, a dozen images are more than enough to illustrate image processing concepts on real NGS data. And it need to be real cause my target audience is mainly composed non computer/biology geeks. They really must feel the complexity of the task. By the way, surface mail is allowed in answers :) </Text>

    <Text>I see very justified critics concerning my FASTA script. Maybe I can offer an explanation as to why it figures here :) The main reason why this is my FAVORITE (which is the question) is that this specific script has been at the core of my Python learning process. Python has opened tons of interesting applications for me in my everyday work. It is also an example of how doing complex things (here at best 'lightly' complex) is rendered easy and even beautiful with some scripting in your favorite language. I do not even suggest you use this. As mentioned, there are dependable parsers out there :)</Text>

    <Text>What do you mean by "raw data are very hard to find"? Are you talking about actual images from the sequencers? Most newer pipelines only store those temporarily, as the terabytes of storage necessary just aren't worth it. The fastq files in the SRA, with unmapped reads and uality scores, are about as close to raw data as you'll readily find. Same goes for the CEL files from microarrays. Showing a representative image can be useful while explaning concepts, but very few analyses that we do actually start from the raw images.</Text>

    <Text>This almost sounds as bad as a bash script labeled "Unix Russian Roulette" I came across some time ago. The script was basically a short one liner that gave you a one in six chance (if you can call it that) of erasing your disk. I was linux-naive enough to try it and, luckylly, I didn't put "sudo" in front of it to gain admin rights... [sic]</Text>

    <Text>@Istvan Albert Just an idea, which you probably have thought about, but why not having the domain name automatically redirect to the biostar.stackexchange site? Concerning the more global aim of this post, I just read your own post about BioStar growth. I will definitely redirect questions I get to work on this group. That sound very promising. Many thanks for being at the head of such an undertaking. Do not hesitate to ask for help in any way! Cheers</Text>

    <Text>@Istvan Albert This may be heretic, but considering the fact that there are 35 people actively contributing, wouldn't now be a very good time to change the domain? Maybe warning people in advance? Maybe sending emails? Not that I think the subdomain is such a negative thing. Coming from StackOverflow, I can only see that being linked to the same kind of highly serious, functional and interesting projects lends biostar credibility. G'night :)</Text>

    <Text>I would go as far as to say that outside of assembly, very few bioinformatics processes require the kind of tight coupling that can't be addressed by smart distributed computing.  FPGAs in particular make the work/$ equation relatively unattractive (both from cost of hardware and cost of development).  GPUs on the other hand, while not suitable for all problems, especially many bioinformatics problems, do change the economics a bit.</Text>

    <Text>MEV is a complete microarray package that is able to handle a myriad of file formats and has several algorithms for analysis, normalization, visualization, among other things. I haven't used it for some time already (we have proprietary tools now) so I cannot say for sure about strong and weak points wit confidence. Anyway, the pros are 1) handles any type of data, 2) cross-platform java application, 3) many analytical options. Cons are 1) sometimes your file format might not be recognized and you would need to work on your inputs, 2) java is sometimes slow

    <Text>I have 20 different uses for these sequences, depending on the project... However, they all have in common that I want to treat the sequences one at a time. The nice feature of pyfasta for me is that I don't have to put all the sequences in an object that has to reside in memory. For multiple Go fasta files, that will matter. Would you post your alternative @nuin ? I am interested to see it. Cheers!</Text>

For FASTQ I will have to use:

grep '^@' my_input_fastq.ftq

Thanks for comm tip. I run away from (f)grep after getting a bit wrong results (names vary in length and can be substrings of other names)   </Text>

    <Text>I use Biopython all the time, but parsing fasta files is all I ever use it for. :)
Two other functions I use for fasta parsing is:
SeqIO.to_dict() which builds all sequences into a dictionary and save it in memory
SeqIO.index() which builds a dictionary without putting the sequences in memory

I was thinking of looking into Biopython a little deeper, since it offers much more than fasta parsing, but did not get a chance. :(</Text>
