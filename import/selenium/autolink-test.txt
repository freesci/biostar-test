URL Autolinking
---------------

http://www.psu.edu or at middle https://www.psu.edu or end ftp://www.psu.edu

but the same is protected as inline code

`http://www.psu.edu` or at middle `https://www.psu.edu` or end `ftp://www.psu.edu`

or as block code:

    http://www.psu.edu or at middle https://www.psu.edu or end ftp://www.psu.edu

Punctuation surrounding the url should be ignored (http://www.psu.edu), http://www.psu.edu, http://www.psu.edu;, http://www.psu.edu:

The same should work for lists

 - (http://www.psu.edu). (http://www.psu.edu )
 - (http://www.psu.edu) http://www.psu.edu.

Biostar Autolinking
-------------------

The parser will now recognize links to this site and will generate more meaningful links from them.

For example the url `http://localhost:8080/p/22/` added to a post will be displayed as http://localhost:8080/p/22. This
works with anchors as well `http://localhost:8080/p/22/#98` will expand to http://localhost:8080/p/22/#98.
The previous style of shortcuts of writing `\post 22` has also been kept functional.

The same type of linking works for user pages. Pasting a link to a user page `http://localhost:8080/u/30/`
will result in it being displayed as http://localhost:8080/u/30/.

To disable autolinking wrap the url into inline code or a code block.

Bioinformatics Terms
--------------------

Certain words such as `bwa`, `SAM`, `samtools` or `bedtools` are automatically recognized and linked to homepage like so:
bwa, SAM, samtools and bedtools.

We started with just a few terms listed above and we are evaluating how well this works in practice.

Gist Embedding
--------------

To embed gists you may use a shortcut `\gist ialbert/ae46c5f51d63cdf2d0d2` or a full link
`https://gist.github.com/ialbert/ae46c5f51d63cdf2d0d2` and each will be displayed as

\gist ialbert/ae46c5f51d63cdf2d0d2

or as

https://gist.github.com/ialbert/ae46c5f51d63cdf2d0d2


Youtube Embedding
-----------------

YouTube embedding works via shortcuts `\youtube _cDaX0xJPvI` or full url embedding `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cDaX0xJPvI`

resulting in

\youtube _cDaX0xJPvI

or

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cDaX0xJPvI
