        <h3>What may be advertised by Biostar users?</h3>

        Individual users may advertise personal accomplishments, research results, research publications, tools and
        techniques that they have developed,
        blogs or websites that they have created, activities that they undertake regardless of whether these have
        any commercial nature.
    </div>

    <div class="par">
        The sole restriction of the user initiated advertising is that the person
        creating the ad must be legally entitled to claim full or partial ownership (at a non trivial level) of the
        the product/idea/concept
        that is being advertised.
    </div>

    <div class="par">
        For advertising outside these conditions please contact the site manager at <code>admin@biostars.org.</code>
    </div>




    <h3>Creating an Ad</h3>

    <div class="par">
        To create a new ad select the <b>New Post</b> button and select the <b>Ad</b> category. The title of your
        post
        will constitute the line that will be shown as the ad. The body of your posts will
        be a regular Biostar post that users can access after clicking the link and should contain further
        information on the advertised product.

        Note that ads will not show among the other posts of the site.
    </div>

    <div class="par">
        Ads have two states <code>Stopped</code> and <code>Running</code>

        Upon creating your ad it will have the <code>Stopped</code> status and it will need to be started to be
        shown
        within the Ad rotation.
        Ads in the <code>Running</code> state will be shown in the top bar.
    </div>


    <div class="par">

        <h3>Starting and Stopping Ads</h3>

        To see a list of all ads <a href="/show/ads/">visit the ad list page</a> also accesible from the navigation
        bar
        on the top right.
        For each ad we will show actions that a current user may take or the <code>&dash;</code> symbol
        if the user may not interact with the ad.
        <div>

            <div class="par">
                <b>Note:</b> A user may choose to start running their own ads or another user's ads! What this means
                that
                a user that wants to run an ad but but does not meet the reputation requirements may ask another user to
                run
                their ad.
                Be advised that regardless of who started the ad only the owner or a moderator may stop an ad.
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="par">
            The creator of an Ad may stop it at any time. Moderators that wish to stop an ad can do so by closing the
            post that
            corresponds
            to the Ad. This will stop the ad moreover the ad can only be run once the post has been opened.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="par">


        <h3>Ad Rotation</h3>

        <div class="par">
            We randomly select one ad from the pool of ads. Due to the caching
            it may take up to 5 minutes for an activated ad to enter the ad rotation.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Users with reputation that is high enough to start an ad may also disable ad display altogheter from their account page.
        </div>

        <h3>Expiration</h3>

        <div class="par">
            Ads expire after one month and at that point will be placed in
            the <code>Stopped</code> state. Users will need to reactivate the ad.
        </div>

        <h3>Commercial Sponsorship</h3>

        <div class="par">
            We expect to reserve about 50% of the ad rotation to Biostar users.
            We will offer the rest of the ad space to commercial entities in return of
            supporting the continuing development
            and maintenance of Biostar. Contact information: <code>admin@biostars.org</code>.
